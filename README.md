# lichtschranke

This Flutter application is part of a time measurment system for track & field training runs.

The application is currently only tested with fairly new Samsung smartphones and tablets.

### How it works
Power on the goal light barrier and connect your smartphone with the Bluetooth device "Lichtschranke".
After the Lichtschranke is paired with your smartphone open the app and tap on the Bluetooth symbol in the bottom left corner.
The status bar at the bottom of the screen should now switch from red to orange and after a few seconds to green. You are now connected to the Lichtschranke.
You might need to restart the application at the first connection attempt.

### Bluetooth debbuging
If there are any issues with the bluetooth connection, you can connect the goal light barrier with USB-C to your Computer and open up Serial connection.
